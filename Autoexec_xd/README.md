# autoexec

A GitHub copy of my `autoexec.cfg` file. 

Note to myself that I currently do not have `autoexec.cfg` file in my steam folder 
because all console commands used in it seem to be persistent throughout Dota 2 Client launches.
But still, let's keep it as memory/reminder of commands I'm using. 

---

### autoexec.cfg location

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\cfg`

### important note 

that I added

```cfg
"/"     "demo_goto 1800 relative"
```

into following file manually: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\YOUR_FRIEND_ID\570\remote\user_keys.vcfg` 
(because IDK - it seems to be a bit buggy bcs chat shortcuts intersect with it, so it does not work through console)
and it seems like it is working without `autoexec.cfg` but if it ever fails then just make autoexec
