### TODO for myself or contributors:

- [ ] Deal with following warning for future work
    ```
    py DeprecationWarning: NEAREST is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 10 (2023-07-01). Use Resampling.NEAREST or Dither.NONE instead.
      .resize((size, size), Image.NEAREST)\
    ```
- [ ] Find a way to show HTML elemts `<table>` even for github preview
