Scroll down the table, choose an emoticon you like - copy&paste the unicode character from the `chr` column into:

* into console for such binds as `bind o "say_team "` - this one is `:pa_kiss:`.  
* into your nickname - note that in this case emoticons will only show up in system-messages such as "Player paused the game". They will not show in chat, kill-feed or anywhere else really, only system messages.

It doesn't matter if you don't own the emoticon pack.
