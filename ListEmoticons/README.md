Scroll down the table, choose emote you like - copy&paste the unicode character from `chr` column into:

* into console for such binds as `bind o "say_team ÓÅ™"` - this one is `:pa_kiss:`.  
* into your nickname - note that then emoticons only show up in system-messages during the game such as "Player paused the game". It will not show in chat, kill-feed or anywhere else really, only system messages.

It doesn't matter if you don't own the emoticon pack.
