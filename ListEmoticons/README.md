# List Emoticons for Dota 2

This notebook is just a fork of [ListEmoticons.ipynb](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev/dota2_notebooks/blob/master/List%20Emoticons.ipynb) notebook by [rossengeorgiev](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev). So all credits to them. 

I made it a bit more readable, added some explanations and rewrote the code to work with Windows Terminal. 

### TODO:

- [ ] Deal with following warning for future work
    ```
    py DeprecationWarning: NEAREST is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 10 (2023-07-01). Use Resampling.NEAREST or Dither.NONE instead.
      .resize((size, size), Image.NEAREST)\
    ```
- [ ] IDK if it is some windows bug, but why VRF decomplier ignores `-o`. Why it throws all images into `D:` root. Write copypaste from the code for now at least.
- [ ] Find a way to show HTML elemts `<table>` even for github preview
- [ ] Add progress bar, bcs this thing is really really long
- [ ] Leave links for Decompiler and MagicImages Windows
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows - portable

https://vrf.steamdb.info/ - CLI Windows x64
- [ ] Format today into readble by everybody
- [ ] maybe add pictures of how to use it as in Tutorial for outsiders.
