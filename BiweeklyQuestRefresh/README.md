# BiweeklyQuestRefresh

The script basically presses "Refresh challenges" button
and cycles over all Dota heroes, so you don't have to press this for all 120+ Dota 2 heroes yourself 
and get a bit of efficiency.

This script also searches for Soul Ring and Midas quests and prints hero names with those (ehm, "why?" you ask me - who knows - they know üïµÔ∏è).  

--- 

 ### How to use 
- Navigate to `Abaddon` hero page (it's for names to be "counted" properly)
- Open "Progress" tab there
- Run the script with `.bat`-shortcut file in repo or just with `.py` file
