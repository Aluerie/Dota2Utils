# D2RoshTimer

It is toned down `D2RoshTimer.exe` of [Fjara's project](https://github.com/Fjara-h/D2RoshTimer)

You really should check [Fjara's project](https://github.com/Fjara-h/D2RoshTimer) yourself. 
It uses GameState Integration to allow user to make a keybind 
which quickly calculates Rosh timers and puts it into your Copypaste buffer. 
I do not advise using `.exe` file provided in this repo 
but instead go check out Fjara's original project. 
I mainly posted it for "cloud" storage reasons.
