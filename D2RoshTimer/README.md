# D2RoshTimer

It is toned down `D2RoshTimer.exe` of [Fjara's project](https://github.com/Fjara-h/D2RoshTimer)

---

I advice against using `.exe` file provided in this repo instead you should check original [Fjara's project](https://github.com/Fjara-h/D2RoshTimer) yourself.

It uses GameState Integration to allow user to make a keybind 
which quickly calculates Rosh timers and puts it into your Copypaste buffer.

I mainly posted it for "cloud" storage reasons.
