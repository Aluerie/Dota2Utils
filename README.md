  Script that auto-clicks "refresh challenges" for DotaPlus hero quests.

* [🖼️ HeroGrids](./HeroGrids)
  
  Edit custom Hero Grids and align categories as you wish. The hero grids the script is made to align/sort are personal but the code code is there.

* [🔨 ItemBuilds](./ItemBuilds)

  Import meta item builds from Dota 2 ProTracker right into your Dota 2 Client hero builds.

* [😳 ListEmoticons](./ListEmoticons)

    Updated fork of [ListEmoticons.ipynb](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev/dota2_notebooks/blob/master/List%20Emoticons.ipynb) notebook by [@rossengeorgiev](https://github.com/rossengeorgiev). You can see all the emotes at [aluerie.github.io/Dota2Utils/ListEmoticons/](https://aluerie.github.io/Dota2Utils/ListEmoticons/)

* [🧦 SocialFeed](./SocialFeed)

  Send messages into your User Feed Profile Widget. Valve removed UI to do it in the client, but it's still possible with a script like here.
