# AHKScript

A GitHub copy of my personal AutoHotkey script. 

---

It includes my special keybinds for Dota 2, League of Legends, Valorant and Elden Ring.

---

In order for the script to work
*  generate `.exe` file with standard Ahk2exe procedure.
* copy `.lnk` shortcut into `Startup` folder (or make a new one)
  * which is reachable with so-named another `.lnk` file in this folder
  * or by `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`
* restart the PC
