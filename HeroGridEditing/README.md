# HeroGridEditing 

Unfortunately, Dota 2 UI does not allow for pixel-perfect alignment and 
overall it is a bit annoying for slight OCD people like me. 
This notebook tries to solve the problem. 

Of course, the hero grids included in code are my personal choice and my personal arrangement but code is there.
